## 🎯 About This Project

This is my **personal developer portfolio** – a space to showcase my work, skills, and passion for web development.  
Right now, it's still under construction 🏗️ but here’s what I’m aiming for:

- ⚛️ Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- 🔥 Animations powered by **GSAP**
- 🛠️ Designed and coded from scratch — no templates
- 📱 Fully responsive across devices
- ✨ Clean, minimal UI with smooth interactions
